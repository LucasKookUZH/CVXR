## What is new?

Version 1.0 is a major upgrade. The improvements include:

- A new reduction framework that automatically chooses the most
  appropriate solver for a problem
- A large number of solvers are now available and they all use native
  `R` interfaces and do not rely on python glue using `reticulate`
- The default QP solver is `OSQP`, which means that some results will
  differ in precision from previous runs. However, ECOS can be
  explicitly specified if exact results are desired
- Strict inequalities are not allowed in constraints
- Facilities for geometric programming

All this while maintaining almost all compatibility with previous
code!
